# THIS IS OLD AND I DO NOT USE IT ANYMORE. PURELY FOR ARCHIVING PURPOSES.

# my_nvim_config
This is my fresh and written from scratch neovim config that I use for daily editing. Feel free to add more stuff to it. 
Everything is in one single file because I wanted something that is easy to change and configure. This still needs a whole ton of work. 
Some things don't even work!
